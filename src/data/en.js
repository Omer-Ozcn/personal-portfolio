    about: `I am continuously developing myself on the path to becoming a proficient Full Stack Developer. While pursuing my Master's in Mechanical Engineering at YÄ±ldÄ±z Technical University, the opportunity to train at WorkinTech arose, and I seized this opportunity to complete 960 hours of Frontend and Backend training across 78 different projects.

After stepping into the world of software development, I focused on designing responsive and user-friendly interfaces, efficiently managing complex data flows, and delivering seamless experiences. I am always open to learning and teamwork, and I am eager to transform innovative ideas into real products.`,
